# MHZ2250- Fundamentals of Algebra - Unit II

## 1. Arithmetic vs Algebra
- **Arithmetic**: Involves basic operations with numbers.
- **Algebra**: Uses letters and numbers to express relationships between quantities.

## 2. Algebraic Expressions
- An expression with operations and variables (e.g., 3n = 24).
- **Variables**: Represent unknown numbers (e.g., n, p, r, m).
- **Coefficients**: The numbers multiplying the variables (e.g., 3, 1).

## 3. Basic Mathematical Operations
- Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of terms.
- **Like Terms**: Terms with the same variable (e.g., 7x + 2y).

## 4. Exponents
- **Exponent Rules**: e.g., y⁵ × y³ = y⁸.
- **Powers**: Powers of numbers and their signs based on odd/even exponents.

## 5. Formulas
- Simple formulas for geometric shapes (e.g., perimeter = a + a + a = 3a).
- Example of area calculation.

## 6. Order of Operations
- **PEMDAS**: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiply/Divide, Add/Subtract.

## 7. Fractions
- **Fractions**: Represent ratios (e.g., 3/4).
- Simplification of fractions using the greatest common factor (GCF).

## 8. Algebraic Fractions
- Simplifying expressions like x³/x⁷ by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

## 9. Multiplying/Dividing Algebraic Fractions
- Use reciprocals for division (e.g., 6/8 ÷ 2/3 becomes 6/8 × 3/2).

## 10. Least Common Multiple (LCM)
- Find the smallest number divisible by given numbers (e.g., LCM of 8n and 2n is 8n).

## 11. Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of expressions involving variables.
