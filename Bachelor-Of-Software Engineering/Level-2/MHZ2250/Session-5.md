## 1. Brackets/ Parentheses

- Brackets are used to indicate that the terms inside them are considered as one quantity.
- **Rule**: When an expression within brackets is preceded by a '+' sign, the sign can be removed without changing the expression.
- **Rule**: When an expression within brackets is preceded by a 'âˆ’' sign, the sign of every term inside the brackets should be changed when removing the brackets.

### Example:
- \( a + b - c = a + b - c \)
- \( - (a - b - c) = a - b + c \)

## 2. Removing Brackets on Multiplication

- A coefficient placed before a bracket indicates that every term within the bracket is to be multiplied by that coefficient.

### Example:
- \( -3 - 2(4a) - 5 - 2(2a) \)
    - \( -3 - 8a - 5 - 4a \)
    - Result: \( -3 - 8a - 5 - 4a = -8a - 4a \)

## 3. Factoring/ Resolve into Factors

### Example 1: Common Factor
- \( 6x^3 - 9x^2y + 12xy^2 \)
    - Common factor is \( 3x \)
    - Factorized form: \( 3x(2x^2 - 3xy + 4y^2) \)

### Example 2: Grouping Terms to Factor
- \( 5a + ab + 5b + b^2 \)
    - Factoring: \( a(5 + b) + b(5 + b) \)
    - Final factored form: \( (a + b)(5 + b) \)

## 4. Factoring Trinomial Expressions

- A trinomial expression has three terms and the exponent of the variable is a positive integer.

### Example: \( x^2 + 3x + 2 \)
- Factorization: \( (x + 1)(x + 2) \)

## 5. Factoring Perfect Square Trinomial Expressions

- Formula: \( (x + a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2 \)
- Example: \( x^2 - 14x + 49 \)
    - Factorized form: \( (x - 7)^2 \)

## 6. Factoring Expressions of Difference of Two Squares

- Formula: \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \)

### Example:
- \( 36x^2 - 49a^2 \)
    - Factorized form: \( (6x - 7a)(6x + 7a) \)

## 7. Factoring Expressions of Sum or Difference of Two Cubes

- Formula for sum: \( a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) \)
- Formula for difference: \( a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \)

### Example 1: \( 343 + x^3 \)
- Factorized form: \( (7 + x)(49 - 7x + x^2) \)

### Example 2: \( 81 - 24x^3 \)
- Factorized form: \( (3 - 2x)(9 + 6x + 4x^2) \)
